Galleriffic - a jQuery photo gallery & slideshow plugin
=======================================================

This is a fork of Galleriffic by Trent Foley. The original project can by found at http://www.twospy.com/galleriffic.

Jay Hayes (http://iamvery.com) made some improvements. This is a fork from his changes (https://github.com/iamvery/galleriffic).

This fork uses a responsive design to better adapt to differing browser sizes, has better support for mobiles,
including touchSwipe support. It also fixes a number of outstanding issues.

The changes mirror what are used in the Gallerific Adobe Lightroom Web Gallery plugin (http://trialsandtravails.blogspot.com/2015/07/gallerific.html).
